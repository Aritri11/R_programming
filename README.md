# R_programming
Basic and Intermediate level R programming using RStudio

Biostatistics and R Programming Laboratory

This repository contains lab exercises, notes, and R code from the BDBP209 Biostatistics and R Programming Laboratory conducted at IBAB, Bengaluru.

The course introduces students to R programming fundamentals and core statistical analysis methods through hands-on exercises using biological and real-world datasets.

üìå Course Objectives

This laboratory focuses on:

Learn the basics of R programming
